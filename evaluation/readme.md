This directory contains evaluation scripts for measuring the **temporal alignment**, **lip readability**, and **expressiveness** of predicted 3D talking head vertex sequences.

## ðŸ•’ Mean Temporal Misalignment (MTM)

This script computes the **Mean Temporal Misalignment (MTM)** between ground-truth and predicted vertex sequences.

We provide example `.npy` files containing both ground-truth and predicted 3D vertex sequences (e.g., generated by the FaceFormer model).

The MTM metric measures **temporal alignment** and supports **one-to-many sequence matching**, such as when multiple predicted sequences are generated from the same ground-truth sequence (e.g., conditioned on speaker identity).
